<h1><b>Why did I join AP Computer Science?</b></h1>
<p>
    To know me, you must first know why I joined this class. My career pathway involves a lot of technology. Being a mechanic/technician means that throughout my life, I'll have to know how to work the different machines around me. Many of these machines include new technology, especially computers. According to recent studies ran by the ASE, newly produced vehicles are now 88% technology based. With this comes the requirement to know how to work with the computers that run these cars. So, dealing with coding will do me a great deal of help if I ever do continue to work on computers in the future.</p>
