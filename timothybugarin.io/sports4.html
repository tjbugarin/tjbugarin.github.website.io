<h1>Sports?</h1>

<p>Growing up, I never played ball sports like football, basketball, tennis, and volleyball. The reason being is because my family was a fighting family. Although they enjoyed ball sports, they more so pushed me into doing combat sports like judo, muay thai, and boxing. But, because I only picked up on judo (Boys and Girls Club) for such a little amount of time, I lived a good portion of my life boxing instead. My uncle has garage trained me to this day and was the very first man to believe in my boxing dreams and really push me to them. Fighting has always and will continue to be in my blood. </p>
