<h2>PORTFOLIO</h2>
<p>Throughout my AP Computer Science career, I have already done a fair amount of work that displays great worksmanship in the craft of coding. This also shows that although this class has just started, my resume for a great AP student is already looking amazing all thanks to my teacher, Mr. Myers.</p>

      <h3>Algorithms</h3>
      <p>At the beginning of this class, we learned about the usage of algorithms in the world of coding. An algorithm is basically a set of rules that one follws in order to produce anything like a hidden message, a code, or in our case, a password. Our very first major assignment that I felt really introduced us into challenging computer science work was our password generator assignment. It involved creating steps (almost like an algorithm) so create unique passwords.</p>

      <h3>Password Generator Steps</h3>
      <p><b>Step 1:</b> <b>(If websites name begins with letters)</b> First letter lowercase, Second letter uppercase of websites name
      <b>Step 2: </b>Name of site is alphabetically translated into numbers <b>(ex:A=1, B=2, C=3, etc.)</b>
      <b>Step 3:</b> Color of sites brightest color in all uppercase
      <b>Step 4:</b> Take out all vowels in sites name 
      <b>Step 5:</b> Last character is websites name lowercase followed by a underscore.<b>(if symbol or number just state it as is)</b>
      <b>Step 6:</b> how many characters are in the websites titles name
      <b>Step 7:</b> The fourth character of the websites name is capitalized <b>(if symbol or number just state it as is)</b>
      <b>Step 8:</b> first and lasts letter capitalized of the website <b>(if symbol or number just state it as is)</b>

      <h3>Blown To Bits</h3>
      <p>It was also our second project that really showed that we could display true intrest in the class by reviewing chapters to the very popular book "Blown To Bits" written by Hal Abelson, Ken Ledeen, and Harry Lewis. But, what was different about this project was the amount of team effort we needed to complete a task. We learned that in life, we will have to work with others even in the solo life of coding. What this project allowed us to do was really brainstorm ideas with our group and pick out which options were for the best of us. </p>

      <h3>Blown To Bits Chapter 4 Summary</h3>
      <p>Blown to bits Chapter 4 is predominantly about how search engines took the world by storm and how it was widely used as a utility tool by the mass with strengths and flaws. With the following creations of search engines such as Google, Yahoo!, Firefox and all sorts, have acted similarly at according steps that would define a search engine and what it does to find what information you’re looking for, Research, Copies, Index, the Query and its understanding, and the relevant results present. The search engine has several algorithms it follows, with recurring problems such as Advertisement trafficking, dismissing specific information, rising trends and follow-ups and all sorts. With the mass production of any tool, consumers may begin to exploit it, this has been a problem for search engines as political figures and students alike have abused the algorithm for personal benefit in different ways.

  <h3>My School?</h3>
  <p>I am a proud student of James Campbell Highschool. I am currently taking as much semester classes in order to get the most absolute amount of credits in the most fastest possible way. But, the one class I did want to take my time on was AP Computer Science. Not only is it an AP class, but it's an AP class that I will most likely be needing for my future career of being a mechanic or technician. It is a class provided thankfully by my school, James Campbell High School, and taught by one of the most enthusiastic teachers in the school, Mr. Myers. I am very glad to be in this class not only because I get to meet new people who are just as interested as me, but because I get to enjoy being challenged while learning so much new things that'll only help me improve in the future.  </p>

    <h1><b>Who is Timothy?</b></h1>
    <p>
    It comes to no surprise that I'm a student at James Campbell High School. Hence why I'm doing this very intriguing HTML project. If you don't know that already, then I just might not be in the right class. But, with all jokes aside, my name is Timothy James Bugarin and 15 years old. My hobbies include working on anything with my hands. This can range from working in a garage to working in a classroom. no matter the learning environment, I will always be willing to work for the better of myself. Other hobbies I enjoy can range to anything from drawing to other things like sports. Throughout my life I have played basketball, volleyball, judo, boxing and lastly muay thai. Unlike most, I really enjoy combat sports more than ball sports. I also really enjoy going to the beach as any kid from O'ahu would. Although I'm not the best at bodyboarding, I still enjoy it and don't mind the punishment of getting pounded by crazy shorebreaks that Hawai'i has an endless supply of. <p>
        
<h1><b>Why did I join AP Computer Science?</b></h1>
<p>
    To know me, you must first know why I joined this class. My career pathway involves a lot of technology. Being a mechanic/technician means that throughout my life, I'll have to know how to work the different machines around me. Many of these machines include new technology, especially computers. According to recent studies ran by the ASE, newly produced vehicles are now 88% technology based. With this comes the requirement to know how to work with the computers that run these cars. So, dealing with coding will do me a great deal of help if I ever do continue to work on computers in the future.</p>
<h1>Sports?</h1>

<p>Growing up, I never played ball sports like football, basketball, tennis, and volleyball. The reason being is because my family was a fighting family. Although they enjoyed ball sports, they more so pushed me into doing combat sports like judo, muay thai, and boxing. But, because I only picked up on judo (Boys and Girls Club) for such a little amount of time, I lived a good portion of my life boxing instead. My uncle has garage trained me to this day and was the very first man to believe in my boxing dreams and really push me to them. Fighting has always and will continue to be in my blood. </p>
